## FreeSWITCH ESL Bindings for Node.js written in TypeScript

This library helps connecting with Freeswitch via the event socket layer and abstracts most of the socket communications to an easy API. Most of the credit goes to [englercj](https://github.com/englercj/node-esl). I've merely ported the code with a few bug fixes, and attempted to define a few types. I've also added a few unit tests.

### Purpose

TypeScript

### Installation

The easiest way to install is via npm:

```shell
npm install freeswitch-esl
```

As in "Mod ESL".
